# Number System with different bases


This program is capable of addition, multiplication and finding difference of positive integers 
## irrespective of any base (3-9 in addition to 2, 8, 10, 16 i.e. Binary to Decimal plus Hexadecimal)

## Features
* You can use all bases from 2 to 10 and 16.
* It is also capable of interconversion of number systems among bases.
* It points out extraneous errors - like if a binary input by user includes 2 it shows invalid input.
* It uses a base class system called "Number"; and derives or inherits all number systems from it through a generalised code of basic   arithmetic operations.
* It has a menu-driven continuous looping program. Initial base selection menu contains only Decimal, Binary, Octal and Hexadecimal; but if you input a different number other than 10, 8, 2, (suppose 3) then it enters the new base mode i.e. Ternary Numeral System and becomes fully compatible with all above operations.
* Restrictions of this program: Divsion, -ve number & floating point number arithmetic not implemented.
